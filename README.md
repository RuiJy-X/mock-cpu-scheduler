# Round Robin and Priority CPU Scheduler Simulator

## Made by: Rujz Jeamar P. Bernaldez

## Description

This project is a submission for the our Operating Systems Course in University Of Negros Occidental - Recoletos.
This CPU Scheduling Simulator developed for the Operating Systems subject. It demonstrates how different scheduling algorithms manage process execution in a CPU environment. The simulator allows users to choose between Round Robin Scheduling and Priority Scheduling, then simulates how processes are handled based on the selected algorithm. This simulator outputs a table of process name, burst time, waiting time, an optionally a priority, then a gantt chart.

## Program Structure

The project consists of multiple Python files:

main.py – This is the main entry point of the program.

RoundRobin.py – Contains the Round Robin scheduling implementation.

Priority.py – Contains the Priority scheduling implementation.

Other supporting modules and files

## How to Use the Program

### Important Instruction

You should ONLY open and run the file named main.py to start the program.
Do NOT run the RoundRobin.py or Priority.py files directly.

Steps to Run

Open your project folder.

Locate the file named main.py.

Run main.py using your Python environment.

Follow the on-screen instructions to input process data.

View the scheduling results and performance output.
